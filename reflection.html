         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Responsive design is the way we should do that using flexible layouts, flexible images to create the web page. The goal of responsive design is to make sure, although visitors use different sized devices, such as small mobile phones, large PC screens, or different browsers, the same web page automatically changes image size and page structure to render the entire web page without confusion and to facilitate user interaction.
         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To make the same web design appear equally reasonable on different screen sizes, I chose to use the One-column Layout method or the Two-Column Layout method.  This avoids the inability to display and interact on a smaller device screen.
         In the CSS file, I used (width: 760px; )  Set the width of the Center Column, though it shows well on small devices. 
         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I think it needs some improved, the width should be changed to use a percentage setting, which would make the whole design more compatible with different screen sizes.

         In the CSS file, I used (width: 760px; )  Set the width of the Center Column, though it shows well between IPHONE 6- IPHONE 11 devices(or  Android devices with similar screen size). 
         But I think it needs some improved, the width should be changed to use a percentage setting, which would make the whole design more compatible with different screen sizes.Especially older phones with smaller screens.
         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I found online that adding a different code to the ‘head' section would allow the page to adjust for the best fit if it detects that the user is using a different browser. It's also a great way to achieve Responsive design.
         <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I've also seen some web pages with CSS files that may use some standard libraries from google. I think that using such libraries might be an easier way to achieve a responsive design.
